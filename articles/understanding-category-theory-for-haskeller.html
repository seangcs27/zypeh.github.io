            This is not another monad tutorial. It is just a note for myself to understand how applicative in Haskell
            works. And I think you should not need any category knowledge to understand this.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you want to understand what a monad is, you should understand how functor works, the definition of it.
            So the dependency will be:<br /><br /><strong>functor → endofunctor → semigroup → monoid → monad →
                applicative</strong>.
        </p>

        <h2>Functor</h2>
        <p>
            Functor is a characteristic of data that can be mapped over.
            It means the data can be generalised if you define the operation that map from this to that, and for the
            data that has this characteristic will able to map data accordingly. Say, lists, array and trees are things
            that can be mapped over.
            <br /><br />
            The definition of the functor in Haskell is
        </p>
        <pre><code>
        class Functor f where
            fmap :: (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
        </code></pre>
        <p>
            Where the definition of the map function is
        </p>
        <pre><code>
        map :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
        </code></pre>
        <p>
            See the differences? <b>fmap only defines the computation between <i>a</i> to <i>b</i></b><a
                href="#footnote-1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>. Where <b>map</b>
            only map a list to a list accordingly to the rules it accepted.<br /><br />
            In other words, for any composite (or complicated data structures), if the typeclass Functor instance is
            defined, it is a functor automatically.<br /><br />
            Like <b>Maybe a</b>, the maybe monad
        </p>
        <pre><code>
        data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a

        instance Functor Maybe where
            fmap f Nothing = Nothing
            fmap f (Just a) = Just (f a)
        </code></pre>

        <p>
            Functors are required to obey certain laws regards to their mappings.
            <ul>
                <li>Functors must preserve identity morphisms</li>
                <li>Functors preserve composition of morphisms</li>
            </ul>


            The morphisms is a term in category theory, it means the transformation (computations) between two
            data types (catagory).<br /><br />

            That 2 laws allow code reusability as for function a -> b, you can get [a] -> [b] in list, <br />Tree a ->
            Tree b in Tree, ... if you implement the corresponding Functor instance.
        </p>

        <h2>Endofunctor</h2>
        <p><strong>Endofunctor is a functor that map a category to itself</strong>. The type signature is fairly
            self-explanatory:</p>
        <pre><code>
        someEndofunctor :: (a -> b) -> (a -> b)
        </code></pre>
        <p>
            For <b>someEndofunctor</b>, if you apply the function <b>f</b> where <b>f: Int -> String</b>, then the
            result will be <b>f</b> itself.<br /><br />


            So in purely functional paradigm, the list data structure is basically a typical endofunctor, it has methods
            like <b>head</b> and <b>tail</b>, and the <b>tail</b> return the list itself, without the head value. So you
            can consume the list recursively.
        </p>

        <h2>Semigroup</h2>
        <p>Semigroup is a characteristic of data that can be appended, and the appended data is a semigroup too.</p>

        <h2>Monoid</h2>
        <p>Monoid is semigroup with an identity. An identity means empty, say, any natural number plus zero is equal
            to the natural number itself, the zero is then an identity in the natural number category. Another example
            is the empty string (<strong>""</strong>).</p>

        <h2>Monad</h2>
        <p>
            Monad is a monoid in the category of endofunctors. It allows programmers to compose the computations in a
            description (eg <code>IO</code> monad, <code>StateT</code> monad...) as it can make computation to carry
            data and pass to the computation itself, and then execute (lift) at once. <b>**Hmm, basically an action
                combinator in program**</b>
            <br /><br />
            There is a lot of resources to read
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/Understanding_monads/State">Understanding monads</a>
                </li>
                <li><a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/All_About_Monads">All about monad from Haskell Wiki</a></li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Applicative</h2>
        <p>
            Applicative are added in Haskell codebase after Monad, but actually it is another special case of
            functor.<br /><br />
            We can have a look from this <b>flip</b> <code>($)</code> function's type signature:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
        ( $ ) ::                    (a -> b) ->   a ->   b
        (<$>) :: Functor     f =>   (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
        (<*>) :: Applicative f => f (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
        </code></pre>

        <p>
            Applicative is technically a functor that has more structure than a functor but less than a monad.
            <sup><a href="#footnote-2">2</a></sup>It is an intermediate class between Functor and Monad.
        </p>

        <p>
            Applicative are widely used class to compose computations without context.
            <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/Applicative_functors#Application_in_functors">For
                example:</a>
        </p>

        <pre><code>
        -- Maybe is a monad and can pass a generalised a to it
        data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a
        </code></pre>

        <pre><code>
        Prelude> 2 + 3
        5

        Prelude> (Just 2) + (Just 3)
        error:
            • Non type-variable argument in the constraint: Num (Maybe a)
              (Use FlexibleContexts to permit this)
            • When checking the inferred type
                it :: forall a. (Num a, Num (Maybe a)) => Maybe a
        </code></pre>

        <p>
            As the error stated, we should have a function and a value both wrapped in <code>Maybe</code> monad.
            So we change our code to this:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
        Prelude> ((+) <$> Just 2) <*> Just 3
        Just 5

        Prelude> (Just (+2)) <*> Just 3
        Just 5
        </code></pre>

        <p>
            <b>(<*>)</b> is one of the methods of Applicative, the type class of applicative functors - functors that
            support function application within their contexts. Expressions such as
            <code>(+) <$> Just 2 <*> Just 3</code> are said
            to be written in applicative style, which is as close as we can get to regular function application
            while working with a functor. If you pretend for a moment the <b>(<$>)</b>, <b>(<*>)</b> and <b>Just</b>
            aren't there, our example looks just like <code>(+) 2 3</code>
        </p>

        <h2>Haskell pattern</h2>
        <p>
            Haskellers do like use operators (one word function, aw). Often, Haskell operators are similar and comes
            with a definite pattern.

            <ul>
                <li><code>f $ x</code> means <b>f applied to x</b>.</li>
                <li><code>x & f</code> means <b>f applied to x</b> too. Just like chain operator in F# or future Javascript <b>(|>)</b></li>
                <li><code>f <$> x</code> means <b>map f over x</b>.</li>
                <li><code>x <&> f</code> means <b>map f over x</b> too.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>So the &lt;<i>operator</i>&gt; means the map over of the operator itself.</p>
