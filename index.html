            <ul class="experience">
                <li>I am responsible for the <strong>Functional Programming Club Malaysia</strong>.</li>
                <li>
                    After graduated from high-school, <strong>I worked as a co-founder and a tech lead in a startup
                        company</strong>.
                    The startup is a marketplace for students' accommodation. I build and design a solution to solve
                    problems
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>During my highschool, attended a engineering competition</strong> that
                    requires us to make a remote controlled boat.
                    I spent one night to do the state machine to manipulate the motor on two sides of the boat. And
                    we
                    use a AM transmitter and
                    solder it on arduino board. That was a hardcore move as other competitors are just modifying the
                    existing remote controlled
                    toy boat.
